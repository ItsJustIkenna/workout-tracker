## Description

An application that allows users to track their daily workouts. This app uses a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handles routes with Express. It is also deployed with Heroku. Users are able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They can track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user can track the distance traveled.
